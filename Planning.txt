Need to determine classes to be used, so I need to think about functionality.

   Input
1.Need a list of strings.
2.Need input for list of strings. maybe an add word button on form, then start once list is populated.
3.Need 3 guesses.
4.Need input for guesses. Maybe have Set Guess 1 for button text, then change to Set Guess 2
     Could have the user select the guess from the combobox, that would make design easier instead of them typing it in.


   Calculation  - List
1.Need a function to compare one string to the next, thinking something like this.
   int charsInCommon(string guess, string other)
       int counter = 0
       for(int index = 0;index < guess.length;i++)
          if(index < other.length)
             if(guess[index] == other[index])
                counter++
       return counter

2.Need a function to discard any words from the list that don't have a comparable number of like characters
  void discardIncorrect(string guess, int correctChars)
     for(string other in list)
       if(charsInCommon(guess,other) < correctChars)
         delete other from list

3.Need to remove guess from list
   void takeGuess(string guess, int correctChars)
     remove guess from list
     store guess string in variable
     store number of correct characters in variable

4.void add(string word)
     add word to list


Calculation-form
1.btnAddWord_click
    call list's add function, passing string as parameter

2.btnBegin_click
  disable add word button
  disable begin button
  enable Set guess button

   Output
1.Update list box to reflect contents of word list






Proposed objects at this point
1.Form - only handles displaying of information
2.Collection of Strings
